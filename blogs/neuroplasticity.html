      <h2>Nueroplasiticity</h2>
      <h3>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity suggests that our brain is continuously developing or re-shaping itself along our experiences through life. Experiences do not have to be successful. It can learn from failures as well and because our brain is not fixed we can develop ourselves and improve ourselves.
      </p>
      <h3>Engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h3>
      <p>
        As neuroplasticity suggests, repetitive practice will make my brain work effectively and productively.  I will build a habit to practice what I have already learned to make the knowledge more efficient. When there is a challenge or failure I will learn new things from them and build new pathways for my brain.
      </p>
      <h3>Ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>repetitive practice, image training will be some of ways to increase it.</p>

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
      <h3>What it is and why it is relevant</h3>
      <p>
        Growth Mindset is that our ability is not fixed at current level but can improve through correct positive mindset. This is relevant to me as a beginner to an entirely new environment. I will most likely fail in many aspects but I need to think I can be improved to a high standard through those failures.
      </p>
      <h3>Integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey</h3>
      <p>
        I will integrate the Growth Mindset to my failures throughout the learning journey at Dev-Academy. I definitely make mistakes and will struggle with competencies however I will think of these as opportunities to tune myself into being a developer and learn new things.

      <h2>Implementing into learning plans and strategies</h2>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset both suggests that our ability is not fixed and can be improved over time and efforts. I will try to locate my weaknesses and strengths as a developer and will put extra effort to overcome those weaknesses and even strengthen those strengths.
