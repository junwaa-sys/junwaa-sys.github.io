          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Throughout the core learning, I have learnt about myself.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              lack of self awareness: I realized that I do not know enough about myself. values, strengths,weaknesses,learning and working styles.
            </li>
            <li>
              I valued being respectful to others too heavily: when I asked people around me like friend, ex-colleague, they told me I concerns others emotions too much.
            </li>
            <li>
              I have a growth mindset: I did not know the concept of the growth mindset before the core learning, but I found that I have this already as I believe in practice makes perfection and through experience including failures can make me grow.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Values help us to decide how to approach learning and programming (or work) and affect attitude during learning and programming.
          </li>
          <li>
            Empathy helps us to work with peers. peers can be co-workers, peer students, teachers (facilitators in DevAcademy case) or group members by enabling us to better understand othersâ€™ emotional status and intention.
          </li>
          <li>
            self-awareness will help us to identify strengths, weaknesses and current status of ourselves and we can plan learning, or programming according to those.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </h3>
        <ul>          
          <li>
            The fact that most surprised me was that I have not really think about myself and have not talked or asked about myself to people around me.
          </li>          
        </ul>
        <h3>
          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As I mentioned above, I have not thought about myself (strengths, weakness, values, etc) finding and identifying those are the most challenging aspects of the core learning.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Because the Bootcamp course is intense and a group programme. We as students will face new knowledge in a short period of time, this can be overwhelming hence we need to manage ourselves well to keep up with the course. Furthermore, the Bootcamp course is group learning. It is important to work well with peers as well as knowing ourselves. we could use experience and learnings in core learning (eg EQ, listening and looping practice)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              I do not think the core learning is a waste of time. As mentioned above,I think the core learning will play an important role when it comes to Bootcamp but even at this stage I have used the core learning as time to know about myself and how I manage myself when I face problems in general. Because I learnt that learning programming is not about how to write lines of code but about how to solve problems and core learning gave me an idea how to approach problem solving and how to manage myself when I am stuck during problem solving.
