      <h1>Problems and Problem-Solving</h1>      
      <p>
        We all face problems throughout our life. If you have not faced any problem yet, you will face one in the future for sure.Hence it is good to know how to approach and solve them. In this blog post I will share my experience about problems I encountered and how I solved them.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Simple problem
      </h2>
      <p>
        During study at DevAcademy, I have encountered various problems. Some are complicated and some are not. I will start off with the simplest problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a coding task to complete in a curriculum and I did coding but the outcome is not what I intended. I used a problem-solving technique called “pseudocoding” which is a technique to simply write the expected outcome of sets of code and the step by step process so I can check I have made all the required processes on my code. There was no problem but  still the outcome was not right. I even searched on google to check if I write the code in the right way.
      </p>
      <p>
        After checking through the code line by line and word by word thoroughly. The error was found and it was a typo in a line of the code. It was a frustrating experience as I thought I checked the codes and the code was written in the right way and there was not much I could do to correct the problem. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a simple problem with one typo in a line of code but took my time quite a lot. The problem would be solved faster and more effectively if I read the error message more carefully and analyze the reason for the error. 
      </p>
      <h2>Complicated Problem</h2>
      <p>
        There was another problem I encountered during the study at DevAcademy, this problem was also a set of code which does not generate the intended outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I have learned from previous problem-solving experience, I checked the code in detail line by line, word by word. I also searched the internet for a possible solution and checked the error message thoroughly but none of those efforts gave a solution. Because I spent too much time on the problem I decided to leave the problem unsolved for the moment and moved on to the next task.
      </p>
      <p>
        Magically, I grabbed an idea while completing other tasks as there was similar code provided in the task and could solve the problem left unsolved previously. After finishing the task, I realized that the problem could be solved faster and easier if I share my problem with peer students as some of them must have done the task where I got the idea to solve this problem.
      </p>
      <h2>Problem-Solving Techniques</h2>
      <p>
        Along the curriculum at DevAcademy, I learned some problem solving techniques and had opportunities to use them in practice. The techniques are pseudocoding as I mentioned above, reading error messages and searching on the internet. I am pretty confident on using all of these technical techniques as I have developed during the course at DevAcademy and during coding as a hobby. However, I feel that I am not confident in asking peers for help as I am somehow not good at asking questions, this could be my personality or not good at summarizing problems for help.
