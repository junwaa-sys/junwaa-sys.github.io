        <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
          </li>
          <p>
            I have not yet set a long term goal. The current goal is to get as much knowledge and experience as I can through the course at DevAcademy and use those to start off my career as developer and hopefully become an experienced developer at the end.
          </p>
          <li>
            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
          </li>
          <p>
            My enthusiasm toward developing will be acting as my strengths as I can fully commit and put my best effort happily to the learning in the Bootcamp. The limitation could be unusual work patterns. As the Bootcamp is group learning I have to adapt my work patterns to others in the group, this will take some time and effort.
          </p>
          <li>
            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
          </li>
          <p>
            As I mentioned above, because Bootcamp is group learning,learning as a group will be the biggest non-technical challenge to me. However all students in DevAcademy are here for a reason, I do not worry about it.
          </p>
          <li>
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </li>
          <p>
            As I mentioned in the early learning plan, I would like to develop negotiation skills. When it comes to group work, there will be a time to adjust workload or time with other members. I was not really good at it but I expect in the bootcamp I would need those times quite often as the Bootcamp is an intense course and I would love to use those opportunities to develop the skill.
          </p>
          <li>
            What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
          </li>
          <p>
            If the Bootcamp team means fellow students in the bootcamp, I expect them to fully commit themselves in the course as I am pretty sure they do as all of us here by choice of our own.
          </p>
          <li>
            What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
          </li>
          <p>
            As I expect from others in the Bootcamp I expect myself fully committed to the course not being distracted by other events in daily life (eg.games or hobbies) and expect myself to deliver works dedicated to me in the group in timely manner.
          </p>
        </ol>

        <h2>Foundation Learning Plan</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
          <p>
            I have not thought about the ultimate or long term goal yet. My current goal is to kick off my developer career as a junior developer and would like to see myself as a developer with capability of handling various languages.
          </p>
          <li>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</li>
          <p>
            diligence and respecting others could be considered as strengths. when it comes to learning in Dev Academy as I commit myself fully to learn new things and respect others when I work in a team.
          </p>
          <li>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
          <p>
            I am not good at negotiating with other team members.  usually accept others’ demand without negotiation. Through learning as a group in Dev Academy, I would like to learn the way to negotiate with other team members while building good relationships with them.
          </p>
          <li>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
              <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            I will set up a daily routine to follow and I will keep the routine as strictly as possible. In this way, I could know how much output I can manage to produce and also other team members can expect me to deliver a stable amount of output from me. However, there must be an occasion where I cannot keep up with the set routine and miss work hours in a day. In this case, I will compensate for the missed hour by adding extra work after normal daily routine. or communicate with other team members to reschedule current work.
          </p>
          <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
          <p>
            The first place to seek help would be the web as there are always others with the same problem hence a solution is likely on the web already. If a solution is not on the web, I will ask for help in the community.
          </p>
          <li>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li>
          <p>
            I expect facilitators to give me advice to think or behave like dev- professional. Instead of giving answers to my problem or question, I would expect them to give me advice on developing approaches to solve those.
          </p>
          <li>
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
          </li>
          <p>
            I do not need regular block-out time but I might occasionally need to drop off and pick up my daughter to/from school in the morning and afternoon. Other than that I do not have other commitments to make aside from the course.
