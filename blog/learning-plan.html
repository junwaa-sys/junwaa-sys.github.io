          <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
          <p>I have not thought about the ultimate or long term goal yet. My current goal is to kick off my developer career as a junior developer and would like to see myself as a developer with capability of handling various languages.</p>
          <li>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</li>
          <p>diligence and respecting others could be considered as strengths. when it comes to learning in Dev Academy as I commit myself fully to learn new things and respect others when I work in a team.</p>
          <li>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
          <p>I am not good at negotiating with other team members.  usually accept others’ demand without negotiation. Through learning as a group in Dev Academy, I would like to learn the way to negotiate with other team members while building good relationships with them.</p>
          <li>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
              <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
            </ul>
          <p>I will set up a daily routine to follow and I will keep the routine as strictly as possible. In this way, I could know how much output I can manage to produce and also other team members can expect me to deliver a stable amount of output from me. However, there must be an occasion where I cannot keep up with the set routine and miss work hours in a day. In this case, I will compensate for the missed hour by adding extra work after normal daily routine. or communicate with other team members to reschedule current work.</p>
          <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
          <p>The first place to seek help would be the web as there are always others with the same problem hence a solution is likely on the web already. If a solution is not on the web, I will ask for help in the community.</p>
          <li>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li>
          <p>I expect facilitators to give me advice to think or behave like dev- professional. Instead of giving answers to my problem or question, I would expect them to give me advice on developing approaches to solve those.</p>
          <li>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</li>
          <p>I do not need regular block-out time but I might occasionally need to drop off and pick up my daughter to/from school in the morning and afternoon. Other than that I do not have other commitments to make aside from the course.</p>
