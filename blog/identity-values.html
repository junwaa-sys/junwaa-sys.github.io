          <li>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</li>
          <p>On this reflection I could not come up with a situation where I needed to make an ethical decision. I could use this situation as where I need to make ethical decisions. I could have made up a situation as if I made some ethical decisions in the past but I choose not to as this would be against my value and is not ethical.
          </p>
          <li>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</li>
          <p>In asian culture, especially the older generation, considers humbleness as a critical  value. Unlike these days, I grew up in the culture and was influenced by it. Alongside the culture, my parentsâ€™ education at home, their values and their behavior influenced me as I grew up seeing them.</p>
          <li>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</li>
          <p>I recognise my strengths as being respectful, creative and diligent toward people around me and toward work I do.
            I think learnings in Dev Academy are structured as group and self motivated learning sharing knowledge and contributing to the final result as a group, for a relatively short and intense duration of course. My strengths like respect to other team members to work on the same project and diligence to fully commit to the work in order to make deadlines would support learnings in Dev academy.
            </p>
          <li>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</li>
          <p>I am not a person with an outgoing personality and talkative, these could probably limit to build a close relationship with a co-worker and might affect productivity when it comes down to group work.</p>
          <li>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</li>
          <p>When doing group work in uni, there were occasions where people in the group were not fully engaged. If I was the leader of the group, I would take over their work instead of chasing them to contribute. I do not think these approaches were not effective. Those times, regardless of final output, I had to put too much of my effort and time to accommodate additional work. If I am in the same situation, I would first try to build a friendly atmosphere among group members and make sure every and each team member contributes their part to the final output. Where, despite the efforts, someone appears to be left out from work, I would negotiate with others to take a portion of additional work. This would maintain a reasonable workload of remaining team members instead of dramatically increasing the workload of one person.</p>
